## What's Machine Learning?

Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that focuses on developing algorithms and models that enable computers to learn from and make predictions or decisions based on data. In essence, it's a way of teaching computers to learn from patterns and data without being explicitly programmed for every task.

### Basic Components

1. **Data**: At the core of machine learning is data. This data can be anything from images and text to numerical values and sensor readings. The quality and quantity of data play crucial roles in the effectiveness of machine learning models.

2. **Algorithms**: Machine learning algorithms are mathematical models that learn patterns and relationships from data. These algorithms can be classified into several categories, including supervised learning, unsupervised learning, semi-supervised learning, reinforcement learning, and more. Each type of algorithm is suitable for different types of tasks and data.

3. **Training**: In the training phase, the machine learning model is fed with labeled data (in supervised learning) or unlabeled data (in unsupervised learning). During this phase, the model learns to identify patterns and relationships in the data.

4. **Evaluation**: After training, the model's performance is evaluated using a separate set of data called the validation or test dataset. This step helps assess how well the model generalizes to new, unseen data.

5. **Prediction or Inference**: Once the model is trained and evaluated, it can be deployed to make predictions or decisions on new, unseen data. This is known as inference or prediction.

### Applications

Machine learning is widely used in various fields, including:
- Image and speech recognition
- Natural language processing
- Recommendation systems
- Medical diagnosis
- Autonomous vehicles
- Financial forecasting
