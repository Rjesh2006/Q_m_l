# ML v/s QML: A beginnerâ€™s overview

Machine learning (ML) and quantum machine learning (QML) are both exciting branches of artificial intelligence (AI), each with its own unique capabilities and applications. Let's explore the basics of each to understand their differences and potential synergies.

## Machine Learning (ML)

Machine learning empowers computers to create algorithms or systems based on the data they receive, enabling them to learn and make decisions autonomously. ML models can be broadly categorized into supervised and unsupervised learning.

### Supervised Learning:

In supervised learning, the computer learns patterns from example input-output pairs to map input data to output data. It includes regression for predicting continuous values and classification for categorizing data discretely. Common algorithms include decision trees, random forests, and neural networks.

- **Decision Tree**: Like asking questions to narrow down options until reaching a final decision.
- **Random Forest**: Multiple decision trees working together, combining predictions to make a final decision.
- **Neural Network**: Inspired by the brain's neuron networking, recognizing patterns with specialized neurons.

### Unsupervised Learning:

Unsupervised learning uncovers patterns and insights from data without predefined labels. Methods include clustering and dimensionality reduction.

## Quantum Machine Learning (QML)

Quantum machine learning utilizes the principles of quantum computing to enhance machine learning algorithms. Quantum computers leverage properties like superposition and entanglement to access complex and higher-dimensional feature spaces, potentially solving problems faster than classical computers.

### Key Differences and Advantages of QML:

- **Superposition and Entanglement**: Unlike classical bits, which can only be in one state (0 or 1) at a time, qubits can exist in a superposition of both states simultaneously. This allows quantum computers to explore multiple solutions simultaneously, potentially leading to faster computations.
- **Higher-Dimensional Feature Spaces**: Quantum computers can access much more complex and higher-dimensional feature spaces than classical computers. This enables them to handle more complex data and perform computations that are infeasible for classical computers.
- **Kernel Functions**: Quantum computers can create kernel functions that are difficult or impossible to replicate on classical machines, leading to more accurate and efficient algorithms for tasks like data classification and pattern recognition.
- **Faster Computation**: Quantum computers have the potential to solve certain problems exponentially faster than classical computers, particularly in areas like optimization and cryptography.

### Potential Challenges and Limitations:

- **Hardware Constraints**: Practical quantum computers are still in the early stages of development and face significant technical challenges, such as maintaining qubit coherence and scalability.
- **Algorithm Development**: Developing quantum algorithms requires expertise in both quantum computing and machine learning, making it a challenging and specialized field.
- **Resource Intensiveness**: Quantum computations often require a large number of qubits and complex operations, which may limit their practical applications in the near term.
