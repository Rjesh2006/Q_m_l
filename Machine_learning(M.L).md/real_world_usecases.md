## Real-world Machine Learning Use Cases

Here are just a few examples of machine learning applications you might encounter every day:

### Speech Recognition

- **Description**: Speech recognition, also known as automatic speech recognition (ASR), translates human speech into written text using natural language processing (NLP).
- **Use Cases**: 
  - Mobile devices incorporating speech recognition for voice search (e.g., Siri).
  - Accessibility features for texting and communication.

### Customer Service

- **Description**: Online chatbots are replacing human agents in customer service, providing personalized advice, answering FAQs, and cross-selling products.
- **Use Cases**: 
  - Virtual agents on e-commerce sites.
  - Messaging bots on platforms like Slack and Facebook Messenger.
  - Tasks typically handled by virtual assistants and voice assistants.

### Computer Vision

- **Description**: Computer vision enables computers to derive meaningful information from images and videos, with applications in photo tagging, healthcare imaging, and autonomous vehicles.
- **Use Cases**: 
  - Photo tagging on social media platforms.
  - Radiology imaging in healthcare.
  - Self-driving cars in the automotive industry.

### Recommendation Engines

- **Description**: AI algorithms analyze past consumption behavior data to make relevant product recommendations.
- **Use Cases**: 
  - Online retailers providing personalized product recommendations during checkout.

### Robotic Process Automation (RPA)

- **Description**: RPA uses intelligent automation technologies to perform repetitive manual tasks.
- **Use Cases**: 
  - Streamlining back-office processes.

### Automated Stock Trading

- **Description**: AI-driven high-frequency trading platforms optimize stock portfolios by making thousands or millions of trades per day without human intervention.
- **Use Cases**: 
  - Optimization of investment portfolios.

### Fraud Detection

- **Description**: Machine learning is used by financial institutions to spot suspicious transactions, both through supervised learning using known fraudulent transactions and anomaly detection.
- **Use Cases**: 
  - Identifying fraudulent activities in banking transactions.
