# Title: Understanding CNNs, RNNs, and GANs in Machine Learning

"""
1. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs):
   - History: Introduced by Yann LeCun in the 1980s, CNNs gained popularity after the ImageNet challenge.
   - Function: Designed for spatial data (images, videos) and visual recognition tasks.
   - How They Work: Use filters to detect patterns and features in input data.

2. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs):
   - Function: Process sequential data (time series, language, speech).
   - How They Work: Maintain hidden state across time steps, suitable for language modeling, translation, and more.

3. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs):
   - Introduction: Created in 2014 for generative AI.
   - How They Work:
     - Generator: Creates new data from noise.
     - Discriminator: Distinguishes real vs. generated data.
   - Adversarial Training: Generator improves by fooling discriminator.
   - Applications: Image synthesis, style transfer, data augmentation.
