### Overview of Perceptron Types in Neural Networks

### Single-Layer Perceptron (SLP)
**Definition**: The simplest form of a neural network for binary classification.
**Functionality**: Limited to linear decision boundaries.
**Training**: Utilizes the perceptron learning rule.
**Limitations**: Suitable only for linearly separable problems.

### Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)
**Definition**: An extended perceptron model with hidden layers.
**Functionality**: Capable of learning non-linear patterns.
**Training**: Uses backpropagation for weight adjustment.
**Applications**: Versatile for classification, regression, and pattern recognition.

### Feedforward Neural Network (FNN)
**Definition**: Neural networks with forward data flow.
**Functionality**: Processes data sequentially through layers.
**Applications**: Suitable for fixed sequence processing tasks.

### Radial Basis Function Network (RBFN)
**Definition**: Utilizes radial basis functions in hidden layers.
**Functionality**: Effective for function approximation tasks.
**Training**: Often trained using k-means algorithm.
**Applications**: Commonly used in interpolation and system modeling.

### Probabilistic Neural Network (PNN)
**Definition**: A neural network with probabilistic outputs.
**Functionality**: Provides probabilistic outputs for classification.
**Training**: Supervised learning to estimate class probabilities.
**Applications**: Used in pattern recognition and data classification.

### Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
**Definition**: Specialized for processing grid-like data.
**Functionality**: Learns hierarchical patterns in images.
**Training**: Utilizes backpropagation with convolutional layers.
**Applications**: Widely used in image processing tasks.

### Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)
**Definition**: Designed for sequential data processing.
**Functionality**: Captures temporal dependencies in sequences.
**Training**: Uses backpropagation through time (BPTT).
**Applications**: Effective for time series prediction and language processing.

### Spiking Neural Network (SNN)
**Definition**: Inspired by biological spiking neurons.
**Functionality**: Represents information using spikes.
**Training**: Often involves unsupervised learning methods.
**Applications**: Used in neuromorphic computing and biological simulations.
