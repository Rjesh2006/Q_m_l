### Overview of Perceptron Types in Neural Networks

### Single-Layer Perceptron (SLP)
- **Definition**: The single-layer perceptron (SLP) is the fundamental unit of neural networks, especially for binary classification tasks. It consists of a single layer of neurons with direct connections to the input features.
- **Functionality**: SLPs are limited to learning linear decision boundaries between classes. They classify inputs based on a weighted sum of their features, followed by a thresholding operation.
- **Training**: SLPs are trained using the perceptron learning rule, which adjusts the weights of connections between neurons based on classification errors. This process iteratively updates the weights until the model converges or reaches a stopping criterion.
- **Limitations**: While SLPs are effective for linearly separable problems, they cannot learn complex patterns or classify data that is not linearly separable.

### Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)
- **Definition**: The multilayer perceptron (MLP) is an extension of the perceptron model with one or more hidden layers between the input and output layers. Each neuron in the hidden layers applies a non-linear activation function to its inputs, allowing MLPs to learn complex, non-linear relationships in the data.
- **Functionality**: MLPs are capable of learning non-linear decision boundaries, making them suitable for a wide range of classification, regression, and pattern recognition tasks. The hidden layers enable the network to extract and represent hierarchical features from the input data.
- **Training**: MLPs are trained using backpropagation, a gradient-based optimization algorithm. During training, the network adjusts its weights and biases based on the error between predicted and actual outputs, aiming to minimize a predefined loss function.
- **Applications**: MLPs are widely used in various domains, including image processing, natural language processing, and financial forecasting, due to their flexibility and ability to learn complex relationships in data.

### Feedforward Neural Network (FNN)
- **Definition**: A feedforward neural network (FNN) is a type of neural network where information flows in one direction, from input to output, without cycles or feedback loops. FNNs process data sequentially through multiple layers of neurons, with each layer applying a set of transformations to the input data.
- **Functionality**: FNNs are effective for tasks where the input is processed in a fixed sequence, such as image classification or speech recognition. They can learn complex patterns in the data by applying non-linear transformations through the layers of neurons.
- **Applications**: FNNs are commonly used in tasks such as image recognition, speech recognition, and natural language processing, where the input data can be represented as a fixed sequence of features.

### Radial Basis Function Network (RBFN)
- **Definition**: A radial basis function network (RBFN) is a type of neural network that uses radial basis functions as activation functions in the hidden layer neurons. RBFNs are particularly useful for function approximation tasks, where they can approximate complex functions with high accuracy.
- **Functionality**: RBFNs consist of three layers: an input layer, a hidden layer with radial basis functions, and an output layer. The hidden layer neurons compute a weighted sum of the input features using radial basis functions, which allows the network to capture complex relationships in the data.
- **Training**: RBFNs are often trained using unsupervised learning methods, such as the k-means algorithm, to determine the centers of the radial basis functions. Once the centers are determined, the network can be trained using supervised learning algorithms to adjust the weights and biases.
- **Applications**: RBFNs are commonly used in interpolation, function approximation, and system modeling tasks, where accurate approximation of complex functions is required.

### Probabilistic Neural Network (PNN)
- **Definition**: A probabilistic neural network (PNN) is a type of neural network model that provides probabilistic outputs for classification tasks. PNNs are based on Parzen window estimation and Bayes' theorem, allowing them to estimate class probabilities based on the input features.
- **Functionality**: PNNs consist of four layers: an input layer, a pattern layer, a summation layer, and an output layer. The pattern layer computes the similarity between the input features and stored patterns using Parzen window estimation, while the output layer computes the class probabilities using Bayes' theorem.
- **Training**: PNNs are trained using supervised learning methods, where the network learns to estimate class probabilities based on the input features and known class labels. During training, the network adjusts its parameters to minimize the error between predicted and actual class probabilities.
- **Applications**: PNNs are commonly used in classification tasks, such as pattern recognition, data classification, and medical diagnosis, where accurate estimation of class probabilities is important.

### Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
- **Definition**: A convolutional neural network (CNN) is a specialized type of neural network designed for processing grid-like data, such as images. CNNs consist of convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers, which allow them to automatically learn hierarchical patterns in the data.
- **Functionality**: CNNs learn hierarchical representations of features in the input data by applying convolutional filters to detect local patterns, followed by pooling operations to reduce the spatial dimensions of the features. This hierarchical processing enables CNNs to achieve state-of-the-art performance in image classification, object detection, and image segmentation tasks.
- **Training**: CNNs are trained using backpropagation with modifications to handle convolutional layers. During training, the network adjusts its weights and biases based on the error between predicted and actual outputs, aiming to minimize a predefined loss function.
- **Applications**: CNNs are widely used in computer vision tasks, including image
