# Quantum Machine Learning Overview

## Introduction
**Quantum machine learning (QML)** is a research area that explores the interplay of ideas from quantum computing and machine learning.

For example, we might want to find out whether quantum computers can **speed up** the time it takes to train or evaluate a machine learning model. On the other hand, we can leverage techniques from machine learning to help us uncover **quantum error-correcting codes**, estimate the properties of quantum systems, or develop new quantum algorithms.

## Quantum Computers as AI Accelerators

The limits of what machines can learn have always been defined by the computer hardware we run our algorithms on—for example, the success of modern-day deep learning with neural networks is enabled by **parallel GPU clusters**.

Quantum machine learning extends the pool of hardware for machine learning by an entirely new type of computing device—the **quantum computer**. Information processing with quantum computers relies on substantially different laws of physics known as **quantum theory**.![image](https://github.com/Rjesh2006/Q_m_l/assets/143868643/cb4ff687-863c-47ee-9ab7-e4ec67180ba9)


## Machine Learning on Near-Term Quantum Devices

Some research focuses on ideal, universal quantum computers ("**fault-tolerant QPUs**") which are still years away. But there is rapidly-growing interest in quantum machine learning on near-term quantum devices.![image](https://github.com/Rjesh2006/Q_m_l/assets/143868643/d776740a-76b0-4f8a-b607-af353cf0bdd7)


We can understand these devices as special-purpose hardware like **Application-Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs)** and **Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs)**, which are more limited in their functionality.

## Using Quantum Computers Like Neural Networks

In the modern viewpoint, quantum computers can be used and trained like **neural networks**. We can systematically adapt the physical control parameters, such as an electromagnetic field strength or a laser pulse frequency, to solve a problem.

For example, a trained circuit can be used to **classify the content of images**, by encoding the image into the physical state of the device and taking measurements.

## The Bigger Picture: Differentiable Programming

But the story is bigger than just using quantum computers to tackle machine learning problems. **Quantum circuits are differentiable**, and a quantum computer itself can compute the change in control parameters needed to become better at a given task.

**Differentiable programming** is the very basis of deep learning, implemented in software libraries such as TensorFlow and PyTorch. Differentiable programming is more than deep learning: it is a programming paradigm where the algorithms are not hand-coded, but learned.

Similarly, the idea of training quantum computers is larger than quantum machine learning. **Trainable quantum circuits** can be leveraged in other fields like quantum chemistry or quantum optimization. It can help in a variety of applications such as the design of quantum algorithms, the discovery of quantum error correction schemes, and the understanding of physical systems.
